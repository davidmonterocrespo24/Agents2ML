Execution error (not missing module). Attempts: 1
ERROR_START:time data "02 Sept. 2024" doesn't match format "%d %b. %Y", at position 0. You might want to try:     - passing `format` if your strings have a consistent format;     - passing `format='ISO8601'` if your strings are all ISO8601 but not necessarily in exactly the same format;     - passing `format='mixed'`, and the format will be inferred for each element individually. You might want to use `dayfirst` alongside this.:ERROR_END
